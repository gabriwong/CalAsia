		<p>Cal-Asia welcomes undergraduate and graduate students who have a deep interest in Asia, a desire to fine tune knowledge of key economic issues that drive development, and a strong interest in sustainability. We are looking for interns who want to take part in our mission to build and enhance California-Asia commercial ties, which we believe lead to jobs and opportunities on both sides of the Pacific.</p> 

		<p>Internship applications are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis.
