Since the country's transition to a more sustainable growth trajectory on higher consumer spending and the development of service industries, a more balanced system will be needed to improve capital allocation. ,The conference is intended to bring together business leaders, policy makers, faculty and students to discuss the new wave of financial policy experimentation in China aimed at addressing structural imbalances and its effects on tomorrow’s economy.",

Hear what he wants to accomplish during his tour in the Western US to build US-Vietnam trade and investment. Bring your questions, business-specific concerns and engage in a productive dialogue. ,About the Consul General ,An Le, a Senior Foreign Service Officer with the rank of Minister Counselor, arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on August 6, 2010, for a three-year assignment as Consul General.  A native of Virginia, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1976 and a Master of Science in Engineering Administration in 1978, both from the George Washington University in Washington, DC.  He joined the Foreign Service in 1991, after having worked as a civil servant with the U.S. Department of the Navy for 15 years. ,During a 35-year career as a U.S. public servant, An Le has won a number of awards, including the 1990 Federal Engineer of the Year Award, the Secretary’s Award for Excellence, a number of Meritorious Step Increases (MSIs) and several Superior and Meritorious Honor Awards.  He was promoted to the Senior Foreign Service in 2001.  In 2006, he received the Department of State’s highest management achievement award – The Luther I. Replogle Award for Management Improvement – for significantly increasing the effectiveness of the Department in fulfilling its foreign affairs responsibilities. ,An Le has had broad experience in dealing with current economic, political and security issues across the Asia region.  His overseas assignments have included Beijing (1991-1994), Tokyo (1994-1997), Kuala Lumpur (1997-2001), Singapore (2001-2004), Seoul (2004-2007), and Paris (2007-2010).  Throughout his Foreign Service career, An Le has worked closely with the American business community to address issues of concern to American investors, business persons, and families working and living abroad.  One of his chief interests has been to anticipate and plan for the educational needs of American expatriate families.  During his tenure in Paris, An Le completed the first-ever public-private partnership in the Department of State to modernize the historic Hotel de Talleyrand, a USG-owned property in central Paris, preserving that structure while transforming it into a modern Class A office space.,More information about the US Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City can be found at: usconsulate.gov,More information about the Vietnamese Consulate General in San Francisco can be found at:  www.vietnamconsulate-sf.org,Cal-Asia Sponsor Members: No fee; email info@calasia.org,Cal-Asia Corporate Member: $50,Non-member: $100 ,Space is limited; $10 drop in charge at the door.
